        <p>
          Ramses II was born around 1303 BCE to Pharaoh Seti I and Queen Tuya.
          As the crown prince, he was given military responsibilities at a young
          age, honing his skills in leadership and battle tactics.

          Ramses became co-ruler with his father in his teenage years, preparing
          him to assume the throne. His upbringing was carefully crafted to
          establish him as a powerful ruler.
